### Day 5: Jan 3, 2020 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: 

Python  

**Thoughts:** 

I wanted to start a more complex project with Python, so after wrestling with pip3 and pygame installations, I began the Alien Invasion project from Python Crash Course.

### Day 4: Jan 2, 2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: 

Python & AWS  

**Thoughts:** 

I re-read the two chapters on lists from the Python Crash Course and put together a simple list exercise.

Now on to a little bit of AWS studying.

### Day 3: Jan 1, 2020 (Happy New Year!)

**Today's Progress**: 

Python & AWS  

**Thoughts:** 

After taking down the Christmas tree, I read on configuring AWS user credentials so as to not explicitly hard code these into code. The AWS CLI and SDKs will automatically check several locations for credentials and configuration.

Next I worked on a simple sorting and comparison exercises in python. Check for permutation.
