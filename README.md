# 100-days-of-code

### Day 3: Jan 1, 2020 (Happy New Year!)

**Today's Progress**: 

Python & AWS  

**Thoughts:** 

After taking down the Christmas tree, I read on configuring AWS user credentials so as to not explicitly hard code these into code. The AWS CLI and SDKs will automatically check several locations for credentials and configuration.

Next I worked on a simple sorting and comparison exercises in python. Check for permutation.
